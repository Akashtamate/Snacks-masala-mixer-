# NEED STATEMENT
## Snack Masala Mixing machine.

A restaurant serves a variety of snacks on their evening menu. The guests desire different types and level of spices on the snacks. The chef wants an automated solution that can help the guests select the desired type and level of spices for any snack. The snack and spices should be mixed by the machine consistently before serving.
