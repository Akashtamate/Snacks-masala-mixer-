# SNACK MASALA MIXING MACHINE
_Draft 1_

**Need Statement:**
  A restaurant serves a variety of snacks on their evening menu. The guests desire different types and level of spices on the snacks. The chef wants an automated solution that can help the guests select the desired type and level of spices for any snack. The snack and spices should be mixed by the machine consistently before serving.

## Why a Snack Masala Mixing machine?
We aim to design this machine subject to the need arisen at a restaurant, to help the customers by automating the snack making process. Automation as a solution will lead to less labor and more satisfied customers.

***

## How to make a Snack Masala Mixing machine?
The machine shall be an integration of many electronic devices like motors,batteries,sensors,and mechanical components like wheels, rods bearings, etc., and combine different ideas, skills, knowledge to build a working automated snack maker.

 ## DEVICES :

**1.** **RPM DC MOTOR:**
DC motor plays a vital role. Motors cause the rotational motion required in our mixing, turning wheels, motion of conveyor belts,etc. DC motors generally convert electrical energy into mechanical energy and a rotating shaft acts as prime mover of the components attached to it.
 Principle involved is, when current carrying conductor is placed in a magnetic field it experiences a mechanical force(rotatory motion in this case).

**2.** **SMALL BEARINGS:**
Bearings help in connecting blades of mixer to DC motor in our machine . It generally helps in reducing friction making rotation easy.



**3.** **PUSH ON SWITCHES:**
Push buttons allow us to control the current supply to DC motor. simple principle involved in it is ,it makes the circuit connected when pressed and breaks when released.

**4** **SENSORS**
An electronic device that senses any physical variation in it's environment like heat, temperature, pressure sound,touch,etc., and converts it into an electrical signal sent to electronic processors for data analysis. IR sensor, Ultrasonic sensor, LDR are a few to name.

**5** **CONVEYOR BELT**
A conveyor belt system consists of conveyor belt of durable,flexible material that passes around two pulleys or equal or different sizes, to transfer materials from a place to another(within small range). conveyer belt is an endless loop that runs continuously by motors attached to the pulleys.

**6.** **PLASTIC BOXES:**
Our model consists of 2 shapes of plastic box. i.e, rectangular and cylindrical. Rectangular plastic Box builds the base  of our model which includes dc motor connections within it ,wherein cylindrical box acts as our mixer which will be placed on the rectangular box connected to dc motor using bolt,nuts, bottle caps with epoxy adhesive and ball bearings.

**7.** **THIN METAL SHEET:**
The use of metal sheet in our model is to build mixing blades connected with DC motor which rotates with certain speed  for the sake of mixing spices and snacks together.

# Our Objectives
* The machine will be automated so as to reduce the work of humans thus saving time.
* The machine will be made cost effective.
* it is user friendly so that everyone will be able to operate it. 


# Functions
* Mixing of snack consistently. 
* Storing snack and masala separately.
* Transporting of snack and masala to the container.
* Serving the snacks to the consumer/customer.


# Constraints
* There are only 4 different choice of spices in snacks. 
* Only one type of snack will be provided to consumer/customer. 
* The time duration for preparation of snack will take around two minutes.

# THE PROBLEM DEFINITION

Design an Automated Snack Masala Mixing machine that is user friendly and cost effective. The machine must be able to mix at least 4 different types of spices in the snack which should be ready within 2 minutes and a customer shall be provided with one snack only. The machine will be mixing the desired amount of spices consistently. The snacks are then transported to the container and finally the snacks will be served to the consumer/customers by a server robo.
