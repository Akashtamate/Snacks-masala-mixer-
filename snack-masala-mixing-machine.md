# SNACK MASALA MIXING MACHINE
_Draft 1_

**Need Statement:**
  A restaurant serves a variety of snacks on their evening menu. The guests desire different types and level of spices on the snacks. The chef wants an automated solution that can help the guests select the desired type and level of spices for any snack. The snack and spices should be mixed by the machine consistently before serving.

## Why a Snack Masala Mixing machine?
We aim to design this machine subject to the need arisen at a restaurant, to help the customers by automating the snack making process. Automation as a solution will lead to less labor and more satisfied customers.

## How to make a Snack Masala Mixing machine?
The machine shall be an integration of many electronic devices like motors,batteries,sensors,and mechanical components like wheels, rods bearings, etc., and combine different ideas, skills, knowledge to build a working automated snack maker.

**Details Of Components Used:**

**1.** **RPM DC MOTOR:**
DC motor plays a vital role in our machine.The blades fixed in our mixer rotates due to dc motor.DC motor generally converts electrical energy into mechanical energy and principle involved in it is ,"when current carrying conductor is placed in a magnetic field it experiences mechanical force(rotatory motion in this case)."

**2.** **DC SOCKET:**
A device(component) connected at one end of DC motor which helps in supplying current to DC motor.

**3.** **SMALL BEARINGS:**
Bearings help in connecting blades of mixer to DC motor in our machine . It generally helps in reducing friction making rotation easy.

**4.** **PUSH ON SWITCHES:**
Push buttons allow us to control the current supply to DC motor. simple principle involved in it is ,"it makes the circuit connected when pressed and breaks when released."

**5.** **PLASTIC BOXES:**
Our model consists of 2 shapes of plastic box. i.e, rectangular and cylindrical. Rectangular plastic Box builds the base  of our model which includes dc motor connections within it ,wherein cylindrical box acts as our mixer which will be placed on the rectangular box connected to dc motor using bolt,nuts, bottle caps with epoxy adhesive and ball bearings.

**6.** **THIN METAL SHEET:**
The use of metal sheet in our model is to build mixing blades connected with DC motor which rotates with certain speed  for the sake of mixing spices and snacks together.
