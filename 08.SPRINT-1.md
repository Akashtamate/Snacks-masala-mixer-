# BUILDING PHASE

## A)SUBSYSTEM NAME:
 ### Mixing and dispensing of mixed snacks.

## B)FABRICATION PLAN:
* The phase includes fixing of acrylic support structures and acrylic linkage on wooden base fabricated by laser cutting.
* Firm fixing of mixing unit made of plastic between the acrylic support structures using nylon rods which makes ease in up and down movement of mixing unit.
* DC motor fixing using foam sheet.
* Connecting linkages with nylon rods of mixing unit and fixed DC motor using nylon rods,creating a rotary to linear motion mechanism.
* Finally, a metal servo is attached to the base of mixing unit whose shaft is attached with round acrylic sheet for dispensing purpose. 

## INTERACTION ASPECT DETAILS:
||Input unit|Dispensing unit|Notification|
|--|--|--|--|
|Energy|No|No|No|
|Material|No|Yes|No|
|Data|YES|No|Yes|
|Spatial|No|Yes|No|

**MATERIAL INTERACTION:** There is a interaction of materials with dispensing unit as spices and snacks are transferred by dispensing unit to mixing unit.

**DATA INTERACTION:** There is interaction of data between input unit and mixing unit because until and unless user gives MIX command through bluetooth, mixing unit does not respond.
There is interaction of data between notification unit and mixing unit as buzzer beeps when mixing stops.

**SPATIAL INTERACTION:** WE can see spatial interaction between dispensing unit and mixing unit, as they are connected to each other by the means of pipe.

## D)CODE:

#include <Servo.h>
Servo dispservo ;
int pos = 0;
int motorpin1 = 11;
char c;
int flag5 = 0;
void setup()
{
  dispservo.attach(10);
  pinMode(motorpin1, OUTPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop()
{
  if (Serial.available())
  {
    c = Serial.read();
    Serial.println(c);

    if (c == '5')
    {
      if (flag5 == 0)
      {
        digitalWrite(motorpin1, HIGH);
        delay(10000);
        digitalWrite(motorpin1, LOW);
        delay(3000);

        Serial.println(c);
        flag5 = 1;

        dispservo.write(90);
        delay(2000);
        dispservo.write(0);
        delay(3000);
      }
        flag5 = 0;
    }}}
