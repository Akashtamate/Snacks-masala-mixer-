What if food was about more experimentation and less tradition? Here is a brilliant cooking machine by Collaborative Cooking that performs heating, stirring and selection of ingredients,all the functions of a chef. In the machine we see that different ingredients(35 kinds), for the dish are stored separately, by motors controlling movements they are put in mixing container and other vegetables slide down to the container where they are mixed and cooked. The machine is coded to cook the dish and Cooking sessions can last for 10 to 20 hours. It also keeps track of functions done.

Four engineers from MIT have opened a fast-food restaurant in Boston that uses mechanical woks to autonomously prepare meals in under three minutes.These robots are designed to simultaneously prepare food in three minutes or less.Customers place their orders using a touch-screen device. Then an ingredient delivery system collects the ingredients, portions them, and delivers them into one of the robotic container.ingredients are then mixed and cooked at 450 degrees Fahrenheit using induction technology.

In this video, a very simple machine is designed to mix flour, but we can make use of the design concept of machine from this video to build a spice mixing machine. With some carpentry work in building model to some use of technical devices we can eventually attain to a finished prototype.
Some components used in this model are:
DC motors, push on switch, nuts and bolts, wooden planks, a metal stirrer, steel bowl and DC supply.

This video is based on making mixer, which actually grinds the raw spices into powder by using sharp blades and high rpm (1200 rpm) DC motor. We can make use of this device for making spice mixing device by reducing the rpm of DC motor and using slightly blunt blades made of metal sheet. This machine works on electricity and DC intake is very high. 
Components used in this model are:
DC motors,push on switch,nuts and bolts, DC socket, small bearings, metal sheet, plastic boxes of different shapes, bottle caps filled with epoxy adhesive.

This video is all about making conveyor belt. The reason behind referring this video is to build a machine which reduces human effort. We can use this in our spice mixing machine as a mode of transportation of spices and snack. 
Components used in this model are:
DC motor, push on switch, battery, tapes,cardboard,pvc pipe tube.

## 2. What are the existing solutions to the problem?

The problem is about mixing different kinds of spices and snack consitently. There are many devices in the markets which do similar kind of work like mixing and grinding.
**Some of the devices are:**

### 1. MIXER

This is a device which mixes lots of things, including raw spices. It even has a regulator which controls speed of the rotating blades. The reason behind not using this finished market product is, there is no such requirement of highly combat device like mixer. As we are just adding spice to existing snack and mixing it together. If we use mixer, it just messes up everything and the final product will not be satisfactory.

### 2. Blender
This machine is quite similar to mixer. Generally used to blend fruits and vegetables which gives juice/liquid as its final product. We cant use this product because we don't need juice/liquid as our finish product.
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71mZyyYl%2BeL._SL1500_.jpg)

These are some existing solutions which are partially satisfactory. Modification to those may help in building a legit device which would satisfy the need statement given.

## 3. Have you gone to any DIY projects?
Yes, we have gone through DIY projects. Some of them are listed below.

https://youtu.be/UsF5Isjdgw4
 
This DIY is referred from youtube video.
In this video making of conveyor belt is shown, which plays vital role of transporting things around and dumping them in one place. This is done by a rolling elastic conveyor belt that rolls over 2 shafts attached to rotating motors(both in same direction). The body of this is made up of cardboard and belt is made up of cycle tube.It runs on simple DC motor.

components used in this DIY project are:
cardboard, pvc tube, cycle tube, dry cell, push on switch,BO gear, dc motor.

This diy is referred from youtube.
in this video making of simple blender is shown by using household things. In other words, best out of waste. In this video a plastic bottle is used to mix spices using a DC motor.

components used here are:
plastic bottle, DC motor, cardboard for blades and dry cell.

https://youtu.be/6H3wVsceoS0

This DIY is referred from youtube.
The content in this video is dispensing of candy using basic cardboard. We can make use of this concept in our machine to dispense spices to the mixing container as per the requirement of costumer.

components used here are:
cardboard,ice-cream sticks and spring.

 ## 4. What direct solutions are available for the need statements given for you?

![](https://5.imimg.com/data5/AX/TU/MY-2081778/snacks-masala-mixing-machine-500x500.png)

This Masala Mixing Machine ensure that you get hygienically prepared and packed food product with minimal human intervention. The Masala mixing machine can be set to add the right quantity of spices to the food products to ensure consistency and quality in the taste of all batches. The only problem with this machine is its cost. This machine is not affordable for everyone and is used well in large industries.

This is a heavy duty Namkeen masala mixing machine used in factory for large scale production of the snack. We see huge spiral blades in the mixing container what rotate continuously to mix the snack and the spices consistently. The machine will be powered by large motors and it consumes lot of power. We also need to be careful about the right rpm of motors used as the container is open and the snack might spill out if rotated too fast.

This is a fully automated mechanical cooking bot. There is absolutely no human hands involved for food preparation here. There are many Robotic Arms doing functions like selecting ingredients, frying, spraying, closing lid of the container. The mixing bowl heats and cooks the raw ingredients and food is ready. The machine also cleans by itself, adding plus point to its features.

## 5. Major components and sub components

### 1. RPM DC MOTOR:
DC motor plays a vital role. Motors cause the rotational motion required in our mixing, turning wheels, motion of conveyor belts,etc. DC motors generally convert electrical energy into mechanical energy and a rotating shaft acts as prime mover of the components attached to it.
 Principle involved is, when current carrying conductor is placed in a magnetic field it experiences a mechanical force(rotatory motion in this case).

### 2. SMALL BEARINGS:
Bearings help in connecting blades of mixer to DC motor in our machine . It generally helps in reducing friction making rotation easy.

### 3. PUSH ON SWITCHES:
Push buttons allow us to control the current supply to DC motor. simple principle involved in it is ,it makes the circuit connected when pressed and breaks when released.

### 4. SENSORS
An electronic device that senses any physical variation in it's environment like heat, temperature, pressure sound,touch,etc., and converts it into an electrical signal sent to electronic processors for data analysis. IR sensor, Ultrasonic sensor, LDR are a few to name.

### 5. CONVEYOR BELT
A conveyor belt system consists of conveyor belt of durable,flexible material that passes around two pulleys or equal or different sizes, to transfer materials from a place to another(within small range). conveyer belt is an endless loop that runs continuously by motors attached to the pulleys.

### 6. THIN METAL SHEET:
The use of metal sheet is to build different key parts which has certain role like, mixing blades connected with DC motor which rotates with certain speed  for the sake of mixing spices and snacks together.

### 7. DC GEAR MOTORS
A "gear motor" may be an AC or DC motor coupled with a gearbox or transmission. A gear motor adds mechanical gears to alter the speed/torque of the motor for an application. This motor can be used in conveyor belt for transportation of spices.
