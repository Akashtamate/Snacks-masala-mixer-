# BUILDING PHASE

## A)SUBSYSTEM NAME:
 ### INPUT AND NOTIFICATION UNIT.

## B)FABRICATION PLAN:
* This phase is all about arduino circuit connections and building MIT app.
* Firstly, circuit connections are done and fabricating it by covering the connections using foam board allowing only bluetooth to be visible.
* An app is made with 6 commands(buttons) for user input using MIT app.
* Finally, buzzer is connected to arduino which serves as notification unit.

## c)INTERACTION ASPECT DETAILS:

### USER INPUT:

||Dispensing unit|Mixing unit|Notification|
|--|--|--|--|
|Energy|NO|No|No|
|Material|No|No|No|
|Data|Yes|YES|No|
|Spatial|No|No|No|

**DATA INTERACTION:** There is data interaction between user input, dispensing unit and mixing unit as mixing and dispensing unit dose not work until and unless user gives commands through bluetooth.


###  NOTIFICATION:

||Input unit|Mixing unit|Dispensing unit|
|--|--|--|--|
|Energy|No|NO|No|
|Material|No|No|No|
|Data|No|Yes|No|
|Spatial|No|No|No|

**DATA INTERACTION:** There is data interaction between notification unit and mixing unit. As mixing unit dispenses the mixed snacks the buzzer i.e, notification unit beeps.
