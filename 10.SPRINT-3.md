# BUILDING PHASE

## A)SUBSYSTEM NAME:
 ### INPUT AND NOTIFICATION UNIT.

## B)FABRICATION PLAN:
* This phase is all about arduino circuit connections and building MIT app.
* Firstly, circuit connections are done and fabricating it by covering the connections using foam board allowing only bluetooth to be visible.
* An app is made with 6 commands(buttons) for user input using MIT app.
* Finally, buzzer is connected to arduino which serves as notification unit.

## c)INTERACTION ASPECT DETAILS:

### USER INPUT:

||Dispensing unit|Mixing unit|Notification|
|--|--|--|--|
|Energy|NO|No|No|
|Material|No|No|No|
|Data|Yes|YES|No|
|Spatial|No|No|No|

**DATA INTERACTION:** There is data interaction between user input, dispensing unit and mixing unit as mixing and dispensing unit dose not work until and unless user gives commands through bluetooth.


###  NOTIFICATION:

||Input unit|Mixing unit|Dispensing unit|
|--|--|--|--|
|Energy|No|NO|No|
|Material|No|No|No|
|Data|No|Yes|No|
|Spatial|No|No|No|

**DATA INTERACTION:** There is data interaction between notification unit and mixing unit. As mixing unit dispenses the mixed snacks the buzzer i.e, notification unit beeps.

## D)CODE:



int buzzer = 5;

char c;

int flag5 = 0;

void setup()

{

  pinMode(buzzer, OUTPUT);

  Serial.begin(9600);

}

void loop()

{

  if (Serial.available())

  {

    c = Serial.read();

    Serial.println(c);

    if (c == '5')

    {

      if (flag5 == 0)

      {

        tone(buzzer, 450);

        delay(6000);

        noTone(buzzer);

      }

        flag5 = 0;

    }

  }

}

# TESTING PHASE:

## FUNCTIONALITY TEST REPORT:
The  machine was completely controlled by bluetooth from this phase. The bluetooth module was working fine commands from the user input(MIT APP) were read and the output was as per expectation. DC motor, metal servo and all the four servo motors were in the business with great functionality.

## INTEGRATION TEST RESULT:
This phase included only arduino circuit connections and building an MIT app. Connections were done with great concentration which gave back good result and building of MIT app was legit. Bluetooth module and MIT app was synchronized perfectly.

## PERFORMANCE TEST RESULTS:
Every user commands were being performed by the machine with no concern except the mixing unit which later was sorted by bringing some minute changes in the code. After testing it for several times we ended up with great response from the machine.
