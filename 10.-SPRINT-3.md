## A)SUBSYSTEM NAME:
 ### INPUT AND NOTIFICATION UNIT.

## B)FABRICATION PLAN:
* This phase is all about arduino circuit connections and building MIT app.
* Firstly, circuit connections are done and fabricating it by covering the connections using foam board allowing only bluetooth to be visible.
* An app is made with 6 commands(buttons) for user input using MIT app.
* Finally, buzzer is connected to arduino which serves as notification unit.

## c)INTERACTION ASPECT DETAILS:
