**AUTO CHEF** is what we came up with for the given need statement **SNACK MASALA MIXING** . The problem identified in this aspect is, one cannot eagerly store, mix and dispense snacks and spices at the same time. Our machine **AUTO CHEF** is an evident solution for the problem identified. The machine is completely automated to reduce human efforts as it is controlled by bluetooth. It stores 3 kinds of spices and one kind of snacks. Storing is followed by dispensing through servo motors controlled by bluetooth.  Mixing involves **ROTARY TO LINEAR MOTION MECHANISM** with the help of DC motor controlled by bluetooth. Finally, the mixed snacks is dispensed from the mixing unit with the help of metal servo. So, this was the overview of the solution.

### FUTURE SCOPE:
_The machine works fine, as it is automated it reduces human effort and we can rely on it. This machine can be used in restaurants which reduces work load on chief. As per performance testing, the machine can mix snacks and spices consistently and continuously for 2-3 hours. Machine is controlled by bluetooth which makes it user friendly. Not only in restaurants this machine can also be used in house for mixing light spices and snacks._
