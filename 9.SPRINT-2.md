# BUILDING PHASE

## A)SUBSYSTEM NAME:
 ### Dispensing of Spices and snacks.

## B)FABRICATION PLAN:
* This phase includes fixing of stands made of aluminum (aluminum rods) on either sides of acrylic support structures.
* A 10 mm foam board is placed intact above aluminum rods(foam board is used for placing storage unit of spices and snacks).
* PVC pipes are then fixed to foam board and mixing unit using hot glue. 
* Finally, servo motors are placed in between the pipes. 

## C)INTERACTION ASPECT DETAILS:
||Input unit|Mixing unit|Notification|
|--|--|--|--|
|Energy|NO|No|No|
|Material|No|Yes|No|
|Data|Yes|No|NO|
|Spatial|No|Yes|No|

**MATERIAL INTERACTION:** There is a interaction of materials with mixing unit as spices and snacks are transferred by dispensing unit to mixing unit.

**DATA INTERACTION:** There is a data interaction between dispensing and input unit because until and unless user gives commands through bluetooth servos attached to pipes wont move and dispensing dose not occurs.

**SPATIAL INTERACTION:** WE can see spatial interaction between dispensing unit and mixing unit, as they are connected to each other by the means of pipe.
